# 🎣 FishIT: A Web3 Fishing Game with a Controlled Economy

> **"Play for Fun. Risk by Choice. No Inflation. The First Economy-Driven Fishing Game on Mantle Network."**

## 🎯 Why FishIT?

**"Play-to-Earn is Dead. Long Live Play-for-Fun."**

The current state of Web3 gaming is broken. Over **90%** of GameFi projects are now inactive or considered dead because they rely on unsustainable inflationary models.

* **The Inflation Trap:** Most games print tokens endlessly to pay rewards. When new players stop joining, the economy collapses, and token value drops by **>95%** (e.g., the Axie Infinity decline).
* **Wrong Incentives:** Players are reduced to "farmers" who tolerate boring gameplay just to earn, leaving instantly when yields drop.
* **Economic Ruin:** Without "sinks" (mechanisms to burn assets), the supply oversaturates, killing the ecosystem.

**FishIT fixes this by removing "guaranteed rewards" and introducing "strategic risk."**

## 💡 Our Solution: The Deflationary Game Loop

FishIT is **not Play-to-Earn**. It is a skill-and-luck-based fishing simulator built on **Mantle**, where every asset has a cost, and value is driven by scarcity, not inflation.

We introduce a **Controlled Economy** model:
1.  **Sinks > Sources:** Players must burn assets (baits/common fish) to progress.
2.  **Risk-Based Rewards:** Higher reward zones require expensive licenses and carry higher risks of failure.
3.  **Thrill & Collection:** The value comes from the thrill of the catch and completing the Aquarium collection, not just token dumping.

## 💎 Key Features: Built for Mantle

We leverage **Mantle L2's low gas fees** to enable high-frequency gameplay actions (casting rods, minting catches) without breaking the user's bank.

### 1. Strategic Fishing Zones (Risk vs. Reward)
Players don't just click a button. They must choose their risk appetite.
* **Shallow Waters (Low Risk):** Low entry cost, common catches. Good for farming basic resources.
* **Abyssal Trench (High Risk):** Requires "burning" rare resources to enter. High failure rate, but the only place to catch Legendary NFTs.

### 2. On-Chain RNG & Fairness
Every cast, catch, and escape is determined by verifiable **On-Chain RNG**. Unlike Web2 fishing games where rates are hidden, FishIT offers transparent fairness logic enforced by Smart Contracts on Mantle.

### 3. Deflationary Crafting System
Most games flood the market with NFTs. FishIT reduces them.
* **The "Burn" Mechanism:** Catch 5 Common Fish? Burn them to craft a Rare Bait.
* **Asset Evolution:** Players sacrifice lower-tier assets to upgrade their fishing rod or license, permanently removing supply from the ecosystem.
